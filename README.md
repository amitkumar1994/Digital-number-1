Question 2 :How does an Active Record work? 

	ActiveRecord is actually represent the model in mvc architecture of rails.
	It’s a layer that responsible for representing business data and logic.
	It is an implementation of the Active Record pattern which itself is a description of an Object Relational Mapping system.

	Object Relational Mapping(ORM), is a technique that connects the objects of an application to tables in a relational database management system. Using ORM, the properties and relationships of the objects in an application can be easily stored and retrieved from a database without writing SQL statements directly and with less overall database access code.

	When you need to make changes to the database, you’ll write Ruby code, and then run migrations which makes the actual changes to the database. 
	It doesn’t matter what database you’re using.
